# Payloads
Assorted PoC payloads - for research purposes only

## Notice

This are all Proof of Concept (PoC) payloads designed to demonstrate certian attack routes and vulnerabilities found within windows and linux systems. By design, these are not designed to function fully in a malicious capability, nor are they meant for that. These are meant to serve as examples and inspiration in relation to security research. In some cases, the core functionality works and the script is instead hard coded for a benign example. In some cases, a script for remidiation purposes to undo the demonstrated function is included.
